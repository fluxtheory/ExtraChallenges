01-Task-Rotating Cube

- GOAL - 
Understand basic Blueprint and C++ logic, Class setup and inheritance. 

1. Look at BP_RotatingCube and see how it's setup

2. Test the class by simulating the level and see the results

3. Note that the BP class is derived from the C++ RotatingCube

4. Look at the different variables, how they're definied and how/where they can be accessed in the editor/blueprint panels

5. When you're familiar with the BP functionality, begin moving the code functionality from the blueprint into the C++ RotatingCube class.

-- HINTS --
- You have the variables you need in C++ 

- Remember to remove your BP code to avoid conflicts

- The names of the C++ functions are very similar, if you need more info on them Google the specific function name in context. i.e "UE4 C++ AddActorLocalRotation()"

- The final resulting functionality should be the same as the BP. Rotating in one direction for x seconds then flipping the rotation direction.
